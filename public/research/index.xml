      <description>One of my main areas of interest is biogeography - where do we find marine species, what are the factors that control their distribution, and where might we find them in the future? As part of the ACLIM (Alaska Climate Integrated Modeling) series of projects led by researchers at NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, I’m developing a suite of species distribution models for groundfish and crabs in the eastern Bering Sea region to support climate-ready fisheries management.</description>

      <title>Predator-prey overlap and predation</title>

      <description>Many studies in marine ecosystems have documented species range shifts in response to climate change, and many more have used species distribution models to project species ranges under future conditions. More recently, multiple studies have employed projections from species distribution models to “rewire” food webs under future environmental changes, moving beyond a single-species focus to characterize ecosystem dynamics via changes in trophic interactions. Presumably, as the spatial overlap between fish and their predators changes over time, so too should predation rates (integrated across space) - but how well can we predict trophic interactions from predator-prey overlap?</description>

      <title>Small-scale fisheries embedded in global trade networks</title>

      <description>Small-scale fisheries are immensely important for the livelihoods, nutrition, and cultural identities of millions of people around the world. However, the impacts of small-scale fisheries on vulnerable marine populations, such as sharks, are less well understood than those of industrial fisheries. Alongside colleagues, I’ve constructed a model to investingate the impacts of a small-scale reef shark fishery, parameterized with data from a Kiribati grey reef shark fishery where reef sharks have been harvested at relatively low rates for cultural and subsistence purposes for generations.</description>
