title: "Forecasting species ranges and spatial overlap"
subtitle: "Modeling the distributions of Bering Sea groundfish and crabs for use in multispecies and ecosystem models"
excerpt: "The Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) is a productive and economically important ecosystem - supporting over 40% of the annual landings in the US - but as the dynamics of the EBS are largely dependent on winter sea ice, it is also very susceptible to climate change. I'm working with researchers from NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science center to build species distribution models to understand how climate change is driving the redistribution of several species of groundfish and crabs. Using these models, we're also working to forecast changes in spatial predator-prey overlap, with the goal of incorporating spatial distribution shifts into non-spatial multispecies and ecosystem models and enabling climate-ready fisheries management."

<p>One of my main areas of interest is biogeography - where do we find marine species, what are the factors that control their distribution, and where might we find them in the future? As part of the ACLIM (Alaska Climate Integrated Modeling) series of projects led by researchers at NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, I’m developing a suite of species distribution models for groundfish and crabs in the eastern Bering Sea region to support climate-ready fisheries management. The EBS is an extensive, shallow (&lt;200 m deep) marine ecosystem spanning 200 – 400 km bordered on the east by the coast of Alaska, and supporting over 40% of the annual fisheries landings in the United States. The dynamics of the Bering Sea ecosystem are tightly coupled to the annual extent and location of winter sea ice and the closely associated oceanographic feature known as the “cold pool,” a sometimes extensive - and in some recent years, entirely absent - region of the Bering shelf with bottom temperatures below 2°C (Kotwicki and Lauth 2013, Ortiz et al. 2016). While the cold pool creates a refuge from predators for some species (notably juvenile walleye pollock, <em>Gadus chalcogrammus</em>, and snow crab, <em>Chionoecetes opilio</em>), the cold pool forms a biogeographic barrier to the movements of other species (such as arrowtooth flounder, <em>Atheresthes stomas</em>), creating structure in their spatial distributions which is otherwise unexplained by local environmental conditions.</p>

<p>In this project, we’re using 40 years of annual scientific trawl survey data collected by NOAA at over 300 locations on the Bering Sea shelf, alongside dynamically-downscaled climate models to relate observed species presence/absence and biomass data to the environmental covariates that shape their distributions. Generalized additive mixed models are an ideal tool for this work, as they allow us to consider not just the nonlinear effects of local covariates such as temperature, oxygen, pH, depth, and sediment qualities, but also the barrier effect of the cold pool through the use of spatially-varying coefficients. We’ve built models for adults and juveniles of six species of groundfish (walleye pollock, Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, Pacific halibut, northern rock sole, and yellowfin sole) as well as snow crab and red king crab.</p>

<p>Species distribution models can incorporated into management in numerous ways, including through multispecies- and ecosystem-based management frameworks, reducing bycatch and human-wildlife interactions, allocating resources and designing scientific surveys, and dynamically placing marine protected areas. One way we’re using them here is by propagating the estimates (and uncertainty) from these models into forecasts of spatial predator-prey overlap, with the goal of using overlap metrics to scale predator-prey interaction rates for some species in multi-species and ecosystem models used for management - “sneaking” spatial range forecasts into non-spatial models and allowing us to test the effect of range shifts on the sustainability of multi-species stocks. As part of this work, I’ve also developed a web app (using R’s <em>Shiny</em> library) to allow for the many outputs from these models to be easily explored and downloaded.</p>
