  My research addresses questions within three broad areas:
show_post_thumbnail: true
thumbnail_left: false # for list-sidebar only
show_author_byline: false
show_post_date: false
show_button_links: false
layout: list


cascade:
  show_author_byline: false
  show_post_date: false
  show_comments: false # see site config to choose Disqus or Utterances
  # for single-sidebar layout
  sidebar:
    text_link_label: View recent posts
    text_link_url: /research/
    show_sidebar_adunit: false # show ad container

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
