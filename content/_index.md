description: Welcome! I'm a PhD Candidate at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station studying climate impacts on the biogeography, population dynamics, and predator-prey ecology of marine species. I combine field and experimental data with a variety of computational approaches - including correlative species distribution models and dynamical population models - to make inferences about climate impacts on coastal marine species and the animals they interact with.
