description: Welcome! I'm a Research Scientist with Andre Punt & Kirstin Holsman at the University of Washington and NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center. My research combines field and experimental data with a variety of computational approaches - including correlative species distribution models and dynamical population models - to make inferences about climate impacts on the biogeography, population dynamics, and predator-prey ecology of marine species.
